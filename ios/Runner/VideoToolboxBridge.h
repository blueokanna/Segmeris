//  VideoToolboxBridge.h
//  Runner
//
//  C interface between the Rust download engine and the native iOS
//  AVFoundation / VideoToolbox transcoder. AVAssetWriter automatically uses
//  the hardware H.264 encoder (VideoToolbox) on every Apple device — A-series
//  iPhones/iPads and M-series Macs — which is what "call the hardware codec"
//  means on iOS.
//
//  These functions are declared `extern "C"` on the Rust side
//  (`rust/src/api/downloader.rs`, gated by `#[cfg(target_os = "ios")]`) and
//  must stay in sync with that declaration.
