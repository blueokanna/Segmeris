//! Optional runtime instrumentation for benchmarks and diagnostics.
//!
//! A [`Stats`] is a set of relaxed atomic counters. Attach one to a
//! server (`ServerConfig::stats`) or a client (`ClientConfig::stats`) to
//! turn performance claims into measured evidence: how many connections
//! were really opened, how many HTTP/2 streams ran on each, how deep the
//! event-loop control queue got, how many poll/wakeup cycles the reactor
//! burned, and how many transport `read`/`write` calls (the closest
//! portable proxy for syscall counts) happened.
//!
//! Counters are updated with relaxed ordering and never block, so
//! attaching a `Stats` costs only a few uncontended atomic
//! loads/stores — safe to leave on in production, useful in benchmarks.
