//! Server-side WebSocket: policy, handshake completion and drivers.
//!
//! # One application API, two drivers
//!
//! An application implements [`WsService`] and returns it from
//! [`crate::courierust_server::Handler::websocket`]. The transport then
//! decides how the service is driven:
//!
//! * **Blocking driver** (`serve_blocking`, private to this module) — one
//!   worker thread per WebSocket. Used for TLS connections and for
//!   `ServerConfig::event_driven = false`. It applies keepalive pings, a
//!   read timeout for liveness, and completes the closing handshake with
//!   a bounded wait.
//! * **Reactor driver** (used by the default event-driven server): the
//!   connection stays in the readiness poller, frames are read only when
//!   the socket is readable, application sends are queued in a bounded
//!   [`OutQueue`] and flushed when it is writable. Ten thousand idle
//!   connections cost ten thousand buffers, not ten thousand threads.
//!
//! Both hand the application the same [`WsConn`] 鈥?including
//! [`WsConn::sender`], a `Send + Sync` push handle for other threads. The
//! *frame* boundary lives inside the sink's lock, so two writers can
//! never interleave a frame's bytes on the wire.
//!
//! # Policy before payload
//!
//! [`plan`] validates the entire opening handshake before a single byte
//! is buffered for the application: method, `Upgrade`/`Connection`
//! tokens, `Sec-WebSocket-Key` shape, `Sec-WebSocket-Version` presence,
//! uniqueness and value (answered with `426` +
//! `Sec-WebSocket-Version: 13` when wrong), the [`OriginPolicy`]
//! (trusted-proxy aware, so an Nginx or Traefik deployment behind TLS
//! still gets a meaningful same-origin check), and the extension offer.
//! A refusal is data ([`WsRefusal`]), so the caller can log the cause and
//! answer with the right status while the connection falls through to
//! the normal HTTP handler.
