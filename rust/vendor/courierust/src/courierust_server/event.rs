//! Event-driven HTTP/1.1 server (every platform).
//!
//! The classic one-pool-job-per-connection model burns a worker per idle
//! keep-alive / SSE / slow-loris connection. Here an event loop parks
//! idle plain-HTTP connections on a readiness poller (Winsock `select` /
//! POSIX `poll`) so they consume **zero** workers, and hands ready ones
//! to event workers in batches. Key mechanics:
//!
//! * A dedicated accept thread only accepts; classification (TLS / h2 /
//!   h1) is a non-blocking peek in the event loop, so a slow client
//!   never stalls the accept path.
//! * A **self-pipe** (loopback socket pair) lets workers/accept thread
//!   interrupt the event loop's blocking poll the instant a control
//!   message is queued — messages never wait for a poll tick, keeping
//!   per-request latency out of the poll-timeout path.
//! * Workers run an **incremental request parser** that resumes where it
//!   left off, so a partial request is parked again, not held.
//! * Connections idle for [`ServerConfig::idle_timeout`] are reaped.
//!
//! Scope: TLS and HTTP/2 connections still use the blocking pool; a
//! long-blocking synchronous handler still occupies a worker.
