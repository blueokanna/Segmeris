//! A reverse proxy: it accepts requests from clients and forwards them to
//! an upstream server.
//!
//! It is a [`Handler`], so it installs on a
//! [`Server`](crate::courierust_server::Server) like any other handler, and
//! it keeps one pooled [`Client`] for the upstream — the point of a reverse
//! proxy is that it does not open a connection per request.
//!
//! What it does, in the terms RFC 9110 uses:
//!
//! * **Routing** — longest matching path prefix wins, and a route may match
//!   on `Host` instead. The matched prefix is *replaced* by the upstream's
//!   own path, so `http://up:8081/base` + a request for `/api/x` on the
//!   `/api` route becomes `/base/x` upstream.
//! * **Load balancing** — a route owns a *set* of equivalent upstreams and
//!   picks one per request, by [`Balance::RoundRobin`] or
//!   [`Balance::LeastConnections`].
//! * **Outlier ejection** — an upstream that fails [`HealthPolicy::failures`]
//!   times in a row leaves the rotation for [`HealthPolicy::cooldown`], so a
//!   dead backend costs a handful of requests instead of its share of every
//!   request for as long as it stays dead. Only *transport* failures count:
//!   an upstream that answers `500` is alive, and ejecting it would turn its
//!   bug into an outage of the whole route.
//! * **WebSocket upgrades** — on a route that opts in with
//!   [`Route::upgrade`], the upgrade is forwarded: the proxy dials the
//!   upstream as a WebSocket client and carries messages both ways.
//! * **In-flight limits** — [`Upstream::max_in_flight`] bounds how many
//!   requests one backend may have open at once. A route that has nothing
//!   left to hand a request to answers `503` rather than queueing it: a
//!   queue needs a size and a timeout, and both of those are a latency
//!   budget nobody chose.
//! * **Hop-by-hop headers** — never forwarded, in either direction
//!   (RFC 9110 §7.6.1). Forwarding `Connection`/`Transfer-Encoding` is how a
//!   proxy desynchronises the two connections it sits between.
//! * **`Via`**, **`X-Forwarded-For`**, **`X-Forwarded-Proto`** and
//!   **`X-Forwarded-Host`** — added. `X-Forwarded-For` is *appended* to the
//!   chain that arrived, because a chain of proxies is the normal case and
//!   overwriting it destroys the only record of where the request came
//!   from — but only when the peer is one this proxy was told to trust
//!   ([`ReverseProxy::trust`]). The header is client-writable, so relaying an
//!   untrusted peer's copy would let any client choose the address the next
//!   hop logs, rate-limits or authorises against; from a peer that is not
//!   trusted, the inbound chain is dropped and replaced with the address this
//!   proxy actually saw.
//!
//! What it deliberately does **not** do:
//!
//! * **No replay.** A request that failed on one upstream is not sent to
//!   another. The failure may have happened after the upstream received it,
//!   and a proxy that silently duplicates a `POST` is a proxy that charges a
//!   card twice. Ejection is the recovery mechanism instead: the bad
//!   upstream stops being chosen, and whether to retry is the client's call.
//! * **No `Upgrade` other than WebSocket.** The server never hands a handler
//!   the raw connection, so an h2c (or any other) upgrade cannot be relayed;
//!   a request carrying one is answered `501` rather than forwarded as
//!   something it is not. Silent degradation here looks like a broken client
//!   for no visible reason.
//! * **No header rewriting beyond the list above** (no `Location` rewrite on
//!   redirects, no cookie-domain rewriting). A caller that needs them can
//!   wrap the handler and post-process the response.
//!
//! The WebSocket path is a *message* relay, not a frame relay: both
//! handshakes and both codecs are terminated here, so a message may be
//! reframed on its way through, and the two legs negotiate their extensions
//! independently — a client that offered `permessage-deflate` keeps it
//! whether or not the upstream also agreed to it. It costs one thread per
//! proxied socket, because the server's reactor polls the client's socket
//! while the upstream leg is blocking.
