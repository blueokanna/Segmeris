//! HTTP server.
//!
//! By default connections are handled by an **event-driven** scheduler: a
//! dedicated accept thread hands sockets to an I/O event loop which parks
//! idle / partial / slow connections on a readiness poller instead of
//! holding a worker thread, so a herd of slow clients cannot exhaust the
//! pool (see [`ServerConfig::event_driven`]). The work-stealing pool runs
//! HTTP/1.1 request handlers and the blocking TLS / HTTP/2 connection
//! loops. Setting [`ServerConfig::event_driven`] to `false` restores the
//! legacy one-blocking-pool-job-per-connection model for comparison and
//! debugging.
//!
//! There are two ways in, depending on who owns the accept loop:
//!
//! * [`Server`] binds (or adopts, via [`Server::from_listener`]) a
//!   listener and runs the scheduler itself.
//! * [`serve_connection`] drives **one** accepted connection — TLS, ALPN,
//!   HTTP/1.1 / HTTP/2, WebSocket upgrades, tunnels — for a caller that
//!   accepts the socket itself: a proxy gating connections by peer
//!   address, a supervisor sharing one listener between services, or a
//!   process that must bind before dropping privileges.
//!
//! Both paths run the same engine; the difference is only who calls
//! `accept`.
